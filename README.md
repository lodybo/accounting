# Accounting
This is my PWA experiminent: a web app where you can add transactions. It will calculate the VAT that you have to give up when you do your taxes.

It's built with the [Angular CLI](README-CLI.md), Firebase and Angular Material. Releases are managed via `npm version` and Zeit's release module, also as an experiment.
